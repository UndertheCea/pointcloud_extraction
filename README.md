# pointcloud_extraction
This repo contains code to interface with the ZED 2i stereo camera and process its output to obtain a point cloud. The code uses the ZED SDK to capture and rectify stereo images, and then applies a depth computation algorithm to obtain the 3D point cloud. The point cloud data is then processed to extract specific features or objects of interest, and displayed in RViz for visualization and analysis.
